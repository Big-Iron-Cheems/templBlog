# Middle

This file is so empty, we should add some content.

```py
# Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a + b
    print()
```

```sh
# Fork bomb (don't run this)
:(){ :|:& };:
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// How to NOT handle null pointers
int main() {
    int *ptr = NULL;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

Now this page looks better. See you in the next post.
